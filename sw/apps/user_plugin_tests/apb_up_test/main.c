  	Programming steps:
	1: continue send voice_data to tx_fifo from apb bus according tx_fifo address

	2: wait tx_fifo in full status, report interrupt to cpu

	3: configue iis send module and receive module ,then start it to send and receive data 
	 3.1:The sending module takes only a piece of data from tx_fifo and sends it out each time
	 3.2:The sending module can send the next a piece of data only when the "send_over" signals is vaild
	 3.3:The receive module receives continuous message
	
	4: wait rx_fifo in full status, report interrupt to cpu

	5: continue receive data from rx_fifo according rx_fifo address

	6: wait rx_fifo in empty status ,report interrupt to cpu
